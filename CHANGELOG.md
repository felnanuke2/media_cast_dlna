**Example migration:**
```dart
// Before (v0.1.3)
Text('${device.manufacturerName} - ${device.modelName}')
Text('IP: ${device.ipAddress}:${device.port}')

// After (v0.2.0)
Text('${device.manufacturerDetails.manufacturer} - ${device.modelDetails.modelName}')
Text('IP: ${device.ipAddress.value}:${device.port.value}')
```
